Library for neural data analysis with the Spark cluster computing framework

## About

Spark is a powerful new framework for cluster computing, particularly well suited to iterative computations applied to large data sets; see the [project webpage](http://spark-project.org/documentation.html). Thunder is a collection of model-fitting routines for analyzing high-dimensional spatiotemporal neural data implemented in Spark.

## Contents

pca.py - do PCA on a data matrix, e.g. space x time

ica.py - do ICA on a data matrix, e.g. space x time

## To-Do

rpca.py - do robust PCA

cca.py - do canonical correlation analysis

fourier.py - get amplitude and phase (in time)
