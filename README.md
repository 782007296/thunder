Thunder
=======

Library for neural data analysis with the Spark cluster computing framework

## About

Spark is a powerful new framework for cluster computing, particularly well suited to iterative computations applied to large data sets; see the project webpage <http://spark-project.org/documentation.html>. Thunder is a collection of model-fitting routines for analyzing high-dimensional spatiotemporal neural data implemented in Spark using the Python API. 

## Contents

## To-Do

rpca.py -- do robust PCA

ica.py -- do ICA (iteratively)

cca.py -- do canonical correlation analysis

fourier.py -- get amplitude and phase (in time)
